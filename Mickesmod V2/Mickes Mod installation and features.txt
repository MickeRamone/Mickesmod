Welcome to Mickes Mod! (see bottom for installation)

Diablo's minions have grown stronger...but so have you... 
Over 200 new Unique items have been added to help you battle the forces of the Prime Evils!

Features:

Items:
- Rebalanced "affixes" and "suffixes" that can roll on "Magic" and "Rare" items 
and even chance to roll new stats that were previously not used in the game 
- Rebalanced Unique and Set items (focus on making useless and underused items to be usable or even very good)
- Over 200 new Unique items added (focus on making all new items fit in with the overall vibe of the game, 
hopefully no new items are too overpowered, but with that said, there are some really good items to find...)
- Gems are more powerful
- Heavily reduced drop chance for Healing and Mana potions(some Monsters can still drop these but 
most of them will have to be bought from Merchants in Towns)
- Removed drop chance for "Other" Potions(such as Fulminating and Gas) and also removed drop chance for Bolts and Arrows and some other misc. items
(goal is to reduce ground clutter)
- Increased capacity size for Town Portal/Identify Tomes and keys.

Skills:
- Rebalanced Skills for most classes (Skills that are weak/underused has seen the most changes)

NPC's:
- Hirelings can equip more weapon types than before
- Some Merchant's can now sell other items than before(for example; Gheed in Act 1 can sell Perfect Gems and maybe even some Jewels)
- Max gold capacity have been increased for Merchants in all difficulties(You can get more gold when selling items that are worth alot)
- Increased chance to gamble rare, unique and set items(yes, now it can actually happen more than once your life!) 

Monsters:
- An overall increase in Monster density
- High level monsters can appear in earlier zones than they usually do, adding more varied difficulty
- "Champion", "Unique" and "Super Unique" Monsters are much more powerful(and can spawn in much higher numbers occasionally)
- Monsters cast spells at a higher spell level than before (For example; instead of just faceplanting firebolts
in the "Den of Evil" without a care in the world, that will no longer be a good idea for a new character...)
- The "Ancients" now drop loot equivalent to "Andariel" (It always bugged me that the Ancients didn't drop any loot,
so now they drop according to Andariels loot table, this may be nerfed at a later time, but it's hella fun as it is :)

Runes/Runewords:
- Since the game has been dominated by powerful runewords for a long time, I haven't changed much here, I've tried to buff Uniques and
other items instead to change up the Runeword Meta. Runewords can still be very effective though ofcourse, but now players should have other
options aswell to pick from.
- I have however increased the gold value of Runes sold to Merchants

Additional Notes:
- Some skills work in a new way in this mod, for example "Thunder Storm" is on a long Cooldown(about 20 sec), but when active it
fires Lightning Bolts very rapidly on all nearby Monsters for a short duration. Use tactics to determine when to best use the boost of this skill.
- "Meteor" also does a percentage of damage as "Physical" in addition to it's Fire damage, 
the total damage can be seen in the "Character" window when you have the spell selected.
- In Diablo 1 some of the Unique items had both very powerful positive stats but also some negative,
I have added some unique items in this style. The interesting challenge is to utilize those items to the fullest by taking advantage of
the good stats while trying to minimize the negative ones.
- This is a work in progress and bugs could be present, but I think I've snatched most of them.
